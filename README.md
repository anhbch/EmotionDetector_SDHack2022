# Eemodoro - SDHacks 2022
Inspiration
Two years of studying remotely undoubtedly take away students' studying flow and structure. For students who used to attend class in person, having a lack of structure might effectively affect their learning ability, and importantly, their motivation. We want to make student gain their studying flow and motivation, so we make Eemodoro.

What it does
Eemodoro (Emotion + Pomodoro) is an app that aims to encourage students to work structurally with the time they have and to know their overall emotions in every studying section.

How we built it
We use Html and Css to build the graphical user interface.
We use face-api.js (the javascript API with face recognition in the browser with tensor.js) to implement face and emotion tracking.
We use Chart.js to visualize data of each emotion on the bar chart.
Flow chart: Click 'Start' to begin a 30-minute timer -> Work on your task until the time is up -> If you want to reset the timer, click 'Reset' -> After 30 minutes, Eemodoro will detect your dominant emotion during your work -> Take a break, enjoy our solution, and reward yourself for working so hard!
Challenges we ran into
We lacked the time and learning to work under the short time constraint was challenging because we kept overthinking, resulting in an ineffective workflow.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy since we know how to absorb knowledge fast as well as comprehensively. This Hackathon strengthens our mentality and gains us the ability to think fast and critically even under a short time constraint.

What we learned
We learn to develop the workflow with git. We also gain insight into app development. Importantly, we learn how to stay calm while debugging.

What's next for Eemodoro
Implement the option to turn on/off the camera
Add activities suggestion based on the emotions
Add more features (maybe more emotions)
Use more effective libraries
Implement database
